## MSK Measure Set
The following provides instructions on how to calculate the MSK 1-10 QCDR Measures set to report clinical performance outcomes for Traditional MIPS and MIPS Value Pathways (MVPs).

## Getting Started
The MSK Measures produce a single (“1st”) performance rate that is submitted to CMS as well as 5 additional strata for examination of observed (i.e., raw, non-risk adjusted) results and by conservative vs surgical care.  

Each measure allows for different valid survey instruments to be used to collect patient reported outcomes for evaluating and reporting clinical performance to CMS. **_Due to lack of data the PENN and IKDC are not currently supported._**


## MSK Measures Calculation Methodology
MSK Measures Calculations, including risk adjustment, is provided below by CMS Performance Period. Choose the desired Performance Period:

* [2026](RY2026/README.md)
* [2025](RY2025/README.md)
