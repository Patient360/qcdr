## MSK Measure Set
The following provides instructions on how to use the MSK 1-10 QCDR Measures set and the risk-adjustment (RA) models used to report clinical performance outcomes for Traditional MIPS and MIPS Value Pathways (MVPs).

## Getting Started
The MSK Measures are multi-performance rate measures consisting of both observed (raw) and risk adjusted performance rates. All quality data submitted to the CMS Quality Payment Program must include both risk-adjusted data along with the observed (raw/unadjusted) patient outcomes for the reporting period. Each measure allows for different valid survey instruments to be used to collect patient reported outcomes for evaluating and reporting clinical performance to CMS.

*Due to lack of data the PENN and IKDC are not currently supported.*


## Performance Measure Calculations and Risk Adjustment
Performance Measure Calculations and Risk Adjustment is provided below by CMS Performance Period. Choose the desired Performance Period:

* [2026](RY2026/README.md)
* [2025](RY2025/README.md)
